### Install Broker

Install A-MQ7 SNAPSHOT download zip from https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots/org/jboss/rh-messaging/AMQ7/A-MQ7/7.0.0-SNAPSHOT/A-MQ7-7.0.0-20161115.042517-83-bin.zip and install into ?
(or https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots/org/jboss/rh-messaging/AMQ7/A-MQ7/7.0.0-SNAPSHOT/A-MQ7-7.0.0-20161115.042517-83-bin.tar.gz )

### Create an instance

Create an instance of A-MQ7
```code
(A_MQ_Install_Dir)/bin/artemis create myBroker
```
### Test The Broker with the CLI and Console
Start the broker
```code
(myBroker_home)/bin/artemis run
```
In a separate shell run the CLI to consume from a default address from the worksheet1 directory 
```code
(myBroker_home)/bin/artemis consumer
```
In a separate shell run the CLI to produce to the same default address from the worksheet1 directory 
```code
(A_MQ_Instance_Dir)/bin/artemis producer
```
Goto http://localhost:8161/hawtio/login and log in using the default user/pass you created when the A-MQ7 instance was created.

### Using a Queue

-   Stop the Broker
-   Add an anycast type address with a queue 
```xml 
<address name="exampleQueue">
  <anycast>
    <queue name="exampleQueue"/>
  </anycast>
</address>
```

-   Start The broker
-   from the worksheet1 directory send some messages
```code
mvn verify -PqueueSender
```
-   from the worksheet1 directory receive some messages
```code
mvn verify -PqueueReceiver
```
### Using a topic

-   Stop the Broker
-   Add a multicast type address with a topic 
```xml 
<address name="exampleTopic">
  <multicast>
    <queue name="exampleTopic"/>
  </multicast>
</address>
```

-   Start The broker

-   from the worksheet1 directory receive some messages

```code
mvn verify -PtopicReceiver
```         

-   from the worksheet1 directory send some messages

```code
mvn verify -PtopicSender
```
   

## Securing a queue

-   Stop the Broker
-   Add a new user to artemis-users.properties
```code
myuser=mypassword
```

-   Add a new role for this user to artemis-roles.properties
```code
mygroup=myuser
```

-   Update the QueueSender and QueueReceiver classes to use the new user and password, i.e.
```code
Connection connection = cf.createConnection("myuser", "mypassword");
```

-   Update the Security Settings to only allow send role for the new user
```xml
<security-setting match="#">
    <permission type="createNonDurableQueue" roles="admin"/>
    <permission type="deleteNonDurableQueue" roles="admin"/>
    <permission type="createDurableQueue" roles="admin"/>
    <permission type="deleteDurableQueue" roles="admin"/>
    <permission type="consume" roles="admin"/>
    <permission type="browse" roles="admin"/>
    <permission type="send" roles="admin,mygroup"/>
    <!-- we need this otherwise ./artemis data imp wouldn't work -->
    <permission type="manage" roles="admin"/>
</security-setting>
```

-  from the worksheet1 directory send some messages
```code
mvn verify -PqueueSender
```
-   from the worksheet1 directory receive some messages (this will fail)
```code
mvn verify -PqueueReceiver
``` 

Play around with security to see how to allow the example to send
